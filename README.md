This repo contains a twitter scraper I used for my dissertation "Information Sharing For Validation: Evidence From Social Networks". 

**Legal Disclaimer**: The author complied with X.com (Twitter)'s code of conduct during the web scraping process. Posts are collected using the log-in information of the author's verified X.com account, respecting the daily user view limit (10,000 posts per day for a premium user.) The paper does not make use of any personally identifiable information or copyright-protected content.
**Note**: The scraper worked as of May 2024. Due to frequent changes in the HTML structure of X.com and updates to the Python packages used in the scraper, some adjustments may be needed to ensure it functions properly. For reference, I made 2-3 major adjustments to the scraper over the course of five months (Jan 2023 - May 2023).
